### `python_projects/`
Notebooks from programming courses focused on learning the basics of **Python for data analysis**.

Includes:
- Loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, arrays).
- Data manipulation and visualization using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

These projects helped build the foundation for later work in machine learning and finance.
