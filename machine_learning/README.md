### `machine_learning/`
Contains the **Predictive Challenge** project from the Machine Learning course.  
Developed a predictive model to identify customers most likely to accept upsell offers.

This project covers the full machine learning workflow:
- Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, and feature scaling)
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning for Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks (ANN)
- Model evaluation using F1-score, AUC, and a custom Capture Rate metric
- Exported final predictions to Excel for business reporting
